    <p>Originating in Argentina and Uruguay, chimichurri is an uncooked condiment that is typically served brushed, basted, or spooned onto food (most often meat like chicken and steak) as it cooks. It may also be served on the side or used as a marinade (highly recommended â€“ best marinade ever). -Jessica Randhawa</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>4 cloves chopped fresh garlic</li>
            <li>1 chopped shallot</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 small red chili</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the chopped parsley, garlic, shallot, oregano, red chili (or crushed red pepper), red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper to the bowl of a food processor. Process until finely minced (take care not to turn it into a thick paste from over-processing).</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and pour the extra-virgin olive oil over the mixture. Gently mix to combine. Allow the Chimichurri to stand for 15 minutes, time permitting.</li>
